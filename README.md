6. **Never share this credentials with anyone**
7. Now you need to get the access_token from the API..
8. After this you need to send this access_token each time you make request to API



### **_I haven't added the .env file here...so make sure if you are cloning the repo...just create a .env file containing the credentials as displayed in the above image.. in the same directory_**
